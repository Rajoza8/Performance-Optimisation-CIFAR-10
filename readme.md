# ECE-GY 7123 Deep Learning Mini Project

The objective of our  mini-project is to design a modi-fied ResNet architecture for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, under the parameter budget constraint of 5 million. To achieve this goal, we experimented with various design choices (explained at length in the Method-ology section) and came up with a modified version of the ResNet-18 architecture, with 12 deep layers. The model performs fairly well, rendering a test accuracy of 90%, while the parameter count is 4903242, i.e., around 4.9 million, within the provided limit.
